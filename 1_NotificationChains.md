# Detailed Interview Revision Notes on Notification Chains 🛎️🔗

## Introduction 📢

Notification chains are a critical architectural concept employed to facilitate communication between multiple parties in a system. This is particularly useful for notifying a group of subscribers about specific events. This design pattern is language-agnostic, meaning it can be implemented in any programming language. 

## What are Notification Chains? 🤔

A **Notification Chain** is a design pattern used to inform multiple subscribers about a particular event. 

- **Publisher**: The entity that generates the event.
- **Subscribers**: Entities that are interested in the event.

This setup typically involves a single publisher and multiple subscribers.

### How Do They Work? 🛠

1. **Event Generation**: The publisher generates or produces an event.
2. **Event Notification**: The event is then pushed to the subscribers who are interested in it.
3. **Registration**: Subscribers can register and unregister for the event with the publisher at their will.

### Who can be Publishers and Subscribers? 🤷

The concept is very flexible:

- They could be multiple threads of the same process.
- They could be multiple processes running on the same system.
- They could be multiple processes running on different systems.
- They could be different components of the same large software system.

## Why is it Important? ⚠️

Notification Chains are significant because they represent a common communication pattern in the software industry. Understanding them will help you handle similar patterns you might encounter in your career effectively.
